## Description
    
This application allows users to view items in a virtual store, add items to and remove items from a shopping cart, and complete a simulated purchase using Stripe.

This project was primarily an exercise in understanding state, and how to implement the Redux package for handling state. I completed this project by refactoring an existing application that used the React Context API for handling state; through reading the Redux documentation, I was able to run the application using Redux to handle global state.

In completing this project, I learned about the benefits of managing state globally, how to refactor existing code, and gained valuable experience in reading documentation to gain competency in a technology.

## Installation
    
To use the Redux Store, clone the repository by running "git clone `git@github.com:the64man1/Redux_Store.git`' on your console. Then use the command 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Then run 'npm run seed' to populate the store with items. Then you can run the command 'npm run develop' to test the functionality of the Redux Store on your port localhost:3000. 

Note: As the Redux Store uses MongoDB for database purposes, users must have MongoDB installed properly on the local device for the application to work locally.

## Usage
    
Users are free to use these files to build their own Redux Store locally, or enjoy the functionality of the site on Heroku.
